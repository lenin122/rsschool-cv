### Self description

32 years old.
Programming language agnostic, I'm sure I can understand and use any people invented technology.
Mostly, I'm working as full stack developer, but 97% of time I'm working with backend and only fix small issues
on front end. I want to have some experience by creating FE app from scratch.
